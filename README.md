# Fire-Dataset
A curated dataset comprising images and their corresponding labels designed for machine learning projects focused on fire detection. This dataset can be used for training and evaluating models that classify scenes as fire or non-fire.

# Fire Detection Image Dataset

This repository contains a sample dataset for machine learning projects focused on fire detection using image classification. The dataset includes labeled images categorized into two classes: `fire` and `no_fire`.

# ðŸ§  Intended Use

This dataset is intended for:

- Training fire vs. no-fire image classification models.
- Benchmarking fire detection algorithms.
- Research and academic purposes.
- This is made out of multiple datasets for the ease of my project's execution.

# Dataset References

As presented in the drive, this dataset is a reviewed collection of multiple datasets, specifically categorised for ease of execution and fast-paced models. This dataset and project is intended to be an educational representation of a Machine Learning Model rather than real life application to detect fire.
